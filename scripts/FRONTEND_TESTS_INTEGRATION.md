# Frontend Tests Integration with Pre-Push Hook

## Overview

Successfully integrated frontend tests using Vitest and Vue Testing Library into Jusky's pre-push hook to ensure code quality and prevent broken code from being pushed to the repository.

## What Was Done

### 1. Updated Pre-Push Hook (`.husky/pre-push`)

- Added frontend tests as step 4/7 in the comprehensive quality checks
- Updated all step numbers to accommodate the new test step
- Frontend tests now run after ESLint checks and before Prettier formatting checks

### 2. Updated Package.json Scripts

- Modified `quality:frontend` script to include `npm run test:run`
- The script now runs: ESLint → Prettier → Frontend Tests → Build

### 3. Fixed Test File Issues

- Resolved TypeScript `any` type issues in test files
- Fixed unused variable warnings in test files
- Applied Prettier formatting to ensure consistency

## Pre-Push Hook Flow

The updated pre-push hook now runs these 7 steps:

1. **PHPStan static analysis** - Backend code quality
2. **PHP tests** - Backend functionality tests
3. **ESLint check** - Frontend code linting
4. **Frontend tests** - Vue component tests ✨ **NEW**
5. **Prettier formatting check** - Code formatting
6. **Frontend build** - Compilation check
7. **Console.log detection** - Production readiness check

## Test Coverage

Current frontend tests cover:

- **TaskCard Component** (11 tests)

  - Rendering task information
  - Status and priority badges
  - Due date handling
  - Accessibility attributes
  - Hover effects

- **TaskForm Component** (11 tests)

  - Form field rendering
  - Create/edit modes
  - Form validation
  - Processing states
  - Required field indicators

- **TaskList Component** (13 tests)
  - Task filtering
  - Empty states
  - Grid layout
  - Pagination
  - Accessibility

**Total: 35 frontend tests**

## Benefits

1. **Early Bug Detection** - Catch frontend issues before they reach the repository
2. **Consistent Quality** - Ensure all code meets quality standards
3. **Automated Testing** - No manual intervention required
4. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Both backend and frontend tests run automatically
5. **Developer Confidence** - Know that pushed code works as expected

## Usage

The pre-push hook runs automatically when you push code:

```bash
git push origin main
```

You can also run the checks manually:

```bash
# Run all quality checks
npm run quality:all

# Run only frontend quality checks
npm run quality:frontend

# Run only frontend tests
npm run test:run

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test
```

## Test Commands

- `npm run test` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:run` - Run tests once (used in pre-push hook)
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with UI interface
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

## Configuration

Tests are configured in:

- `vite.config.ts` - Vitest configuration
- `tests/frontend/setup.ts` - Test setup and global configurations

## Next Steps

Consider adding:

- More component tests as new components are created
- Integration tests for complex user flows
- Visual regression tests
- Performance tests
- E2E tests with Playwright

## Troubleshooting

If the pre-push hook fails:

1. **Frontend tests fail**: Run `npm run test` to see detailed error messages
2. **ESLint issues**: Run `npm run lint` to auto-fix issues
3. **Formatting issues**: Run `npm run format` to fix formatting
4. **Build issues**: Check for TypeScript errors and missing dependencies

The hook will prevent the push until all issues are resolved, ensuring code quality.
